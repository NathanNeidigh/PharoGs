    "GemStone: 
    Try to evaluate the receiver, which should be a zero-argument block.
    If an exception occurs and the expression
        exceptionSelector handles: theExceptionInstance
    returns true, then evaluate the one argument block handlerBlock , 
    passing it the exception instance as its argument.

    Two forms are supported directly by the VM, and the 'fast path code'
    below is used.
        (1) on: anException do: handlerBlock
        (2) on: anExceptionSet do: handlerBlock
    A third form is handled by Smalltalk code in the body of this method,
    and for this form only, #handles is sent to anObject to determine
    whether an exception should be handled .
        (3) on: anObject     do: handlerBlock

    anException must be the class Exception  or a subclass thereof ;
    anExceptionSet must be a kind of ExceptionSet;
    handlerBlock must be an instance of ExecBloc otherwise an error is generated.

    For forms 1,2,3 if handlerBlock expects more than 1 argument,
    an error is generated if exception handling attempts to
    invoke that handlerBlock.  

    If handlerBlock is invoked to handle an Exception which occurs during
    execution of the receiver and handlerBlock completes normally , then
    the result of handlerBlock (value of last expression in handlerBlock)
    will be the result of the on:do: send .  Other-than-normal
    completion of handlerBlock is available by use of 
    Exception's instance methods such as
        #return  #return:  #retry #retryUsing: #resume #resume: #pass #outer 
    within handlerBlock 

    For forms 1 and 2, when searching for a handlerBlock to handle a signaled Exception, 
    the VM uses Behavior>>_subclassOf: semantics . classHistories of the 
    class of the signaled Exception and of anException or elements of anExceptionSet
